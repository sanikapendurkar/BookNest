        <p>Major Tommy Black is at the crossroads of a brilliant, clandestine career. Lost... without purpose or mission. His life in sealed records and whispered stories of his violent exploits. Devastated and blaming himself when a member of his covert task force commits suicide, but when the man’s daughter is kidnapped, Black, the man with “a talent for violence,” sacrifices all for the nearly impossible chance to save the girl... and maybe his soul.</p>
        <p>For fans of Robert Ludlum and Lee Child, BLACK FIRE is a “tour de force of explosive action” that takes the reader on an epic, breathtaking adventure from the exotic Indian Ocean island of Mauritius to the remote interior of South Africa and across Europe into the towering mountains of Central Asia, and introduces a riveting new hero to cheer along with Reacher and Bourne — Tommy Black.</p>

        <p>Blake Hudson just wants to serve his country well as a lawyer for the United States Justice Department—but when an unknown threat begins plotting his downfall, he must find who is setting him up before it costs him his life.</p>
        <p>Scavenger Hunt is a suspense novel chronicling the plight of Blake Hudson, a Justice Department lawyer assigned to a clandestine counterterrorist group created to bypass onerous legal requirements. After the group mysteriously disbands, Hudson becomes the scapegoat and is transformed from hunter to hunted. As he searches for answers and attempts to piece the puzzle together, people are following him, trying to kill </p>
        <p>Written for fans of fast-paced thrillers, dry humor, political gamesmanship, and Clue-like twists and turns, Scavenger Hunt carves out a distinct niche best described as a hybrid of the Robert Ludlum classics and works by Brad Meltzer. Blake Hudson’s story addresses issues that have shaped recent elections and continue to frustrate interest groups and government leaders, while featuring the inner workings of the U.S. Department of Justice Building—arguably the most important and misunderstood agency in the federal government. Author Chad Boudreaux’s unique voice and page-turning storytelling packs a plot-driven punch that readers won’t be able to put down.</p>
