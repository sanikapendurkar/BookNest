        <p>As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.</p>
        <p>That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding... six-pack abs</p>
        <p>Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.</p>

        <p>Catalina Martín desperately needs a date to her sister’s wedding. Especially since her little white lie about her American boyfriend has spiralled out of control. Now everyone she knows—including her ex and his fiancée—will be there and eager to meet him.</p>
        <p>She only has four weeks to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic and aid in her deception. New York to Spain is no short flight and her raucous family won’t be easy to fool.</p>
        <p>Enter Aaron Blackford—her tall, handsome, condescending colleague—who surprisingly offers to step in. She’d rather refuse; never has there been a more aggravating, blood-boiling, and insufferable man.</p>
        <p>But Catalina is desperate, and as the wedding draws nearer, Aaron looks like her best option. And she begins to realize he might not be as terrible in the real world as he is at the office.</p>

            I'm in the business of creating fairy tales.
            Theme parks. Production companies. Five-star hotels.
            Everything could be all mine if I renovated Dreamland.
            My initial idea of hiring Zahra was good in theory, but then I kissed her.
            Things spiraled out of control once I texted her using an alias.
            By the time I realized where I went wrong, it was too late.
            People like me don't get happy endings.
            Not when we're destined to ruin them.</p>
        <p>Zahra<br>
            After submitting a drunk proposal criticizing Dreamland's most expensive ride, I should have been fired.
            Instead, Rowan Kane offered me a dream job.
            The catch? I had to work for the most difficult boss I'd ever met.
            Rowan was rude and completely off-limits, but my heart didn't care.
            At least not until I discovered his secret.
            It was time to teach the billionaire that money couldn't fix everything.
            Especially not us.</p>

        <p>First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz is the closest thing to a prince this side of the Atlantic. With his intrepid sister and the Veep’s genius granddaughter, they’re the White House Trio, a beautiful millennial marketing strategy for his mother, President Ellen Claremont. International socialite duties do have downsides—namely, when photos of a confrontation with his longtime nemesis Prince Henry at a royal wedding leak to the tabloids and threaten American/British relations. The plan for damage control: staging a fake friendship between the First Son and the Prince.</p>
        <p>As President Claremont kicks off her reelection bid, Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret relationship with Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations. What is worth the sacrifice? How do you do all the good you can do? And, most importantly, how will history remember you?</p>
